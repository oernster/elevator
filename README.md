# Installation and run instructions

## Clone the repo.

# To navigate: 

The React front end will launch and allow you to communicate with the backend invisibly.

If you want to the REST API endpoints directly then you can go to 127.0.0.1:8000 and play with whichever URLs you want to from urls.py.

The React front end is available from http://localhost:3000/
